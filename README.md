# Lottery React

This is a POC for a simple token lottery/raffle front end application that uses the Ethereum contract ABI and bytecode deployed from the [lottery-node](https://github.com/perrywortman/lottery-node) repo.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have the [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) chrome extension installed and are using the Rinkeby network. Please DO NOT send funds from the Main network, they will be lost. Rinkeby faucet funds can be found [here](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/).

### Installation

npm i
```

### Development
